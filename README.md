# Save-Battery

Leaving the battery plugged in when fully-charged will reduce its useful life. 

That is, the maximum capacity of the battery will decline, thereby making a "full charge" refer to a state with less energy than a "full charge" previously denoted.  Note, however, that in general a lithium ion's battery life is measured in "charge cycles." This term refers to the charging and discharging of the battery; that is, do each of these once, and that is one "charge cycle." 

Thus, in order to maximize the length of time over which your battery remains able to hold enough of a charge to be useful, I would suggest minimizing the time that the battery remains plugged in while fully charged. While constantly discharging and recharging fully would be better than leaving the battery plugged in, the better treatment is to not have the battery plugged in.
